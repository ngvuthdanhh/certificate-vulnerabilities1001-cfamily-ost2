# 🛣️ Learning Roadmap – Vulnerabilities 1001

## Phase 1: Fundamentals
- Review C memory layout (stack, heap, data, text segments).
- Practice writing simple C programs and analyzing disassembly.

## Phase 2: Vulnerability Classes
- Study each vulnerability (BOF, format string, integer overflow, UAF).
- Take notes in `modules/`.

## Phase 3: Labs
- Perform exploitation labs under controlled environments.
- Document results in `labs/`.

## Phase 4: Mitigations
- Research compiler options and OS-level defenses.
- Compare effectiveness of different mitigations.

## Phase 5: Research & Case Studies
- Explore famous CVEs related to C-family vulnerabilities.
- Write summaries in `research/`.

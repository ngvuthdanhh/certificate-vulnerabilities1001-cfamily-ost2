# 📘 Overview – Vulnerabilities 1001: C-Family Software Implementation Vulnerabilities

This repository contains my personal notes, labs, and study materials from the course **"Vulnerabilities 1001: C-Family Software Implementation Vulnerabilities"** offered by OpenSecurityTraining2 (OST2).  

The course focuses on understanding **common software vulnerabilities in C/C++ codebases**, analyzing their root causes, and practicing exploit techniques, while also emphasizing secure coding practices and mitigations.

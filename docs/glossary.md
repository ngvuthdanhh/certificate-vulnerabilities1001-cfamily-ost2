# 📖 Glossary – Vulnerabilities 1001

- **BOF (Buffer Overflow):** Writing outside the allocated memory buffer, often leading to control flow hijacking.
- **Format String Bug:** Vulnerability caused by unvalidated input in formatted output functions (`printf`, etc.).
- **UAF (Use-After-Free):** Accessing memory after it has been freed, causing undefined behavior.
- **ROP (Return-Oriented Programming):** Exploitation technique chaining small instruction sequences to bypass mitigations.
- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization):** Defense mechanism randomizing memory locations to make exploitation harder.
- **Canary:** A special value placed before the return address on the stack to detect corruption.
- **Integer Overflow:** Error when arithmetic exceeds the representable range of an integer type.
- **CFI (Control Flow Integrity):** Security measure to ensure execution follows valid paths.
